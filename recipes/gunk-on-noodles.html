    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Want some gunk? My mother came up with this wonderfully simple dish on a snowy Michigan night when all she had on hand was a pound of ground beef. My father and I just loved it, and when Dad asked her what it was called she laughed and said 'Gunk on Noodles.'</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounce package uncooked egg noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) can sliced mushrooms with juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
